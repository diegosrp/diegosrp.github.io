In the multicloud bootcamp I participated in, organized by **The Cloud Bootcamp**, a very interesting scenario was covered:

The challenge was to migrate a small townâ€™s vaccine control system from an on-premises environment to the cloud, as the local servers could no longer handle the high demand.

The solution involved:

- **Containerizing the application**: Creating an image and publishing it on Docker Hub.  
- **Provisioning on Kubernetes**: Using Google Cloud Platform infrastructure.  
- **Migrating the database**: Using Cloud SQL.  
- **Integrating with AWS S3**: For storing awareness forms.  
- **Infrastructure as code**: Everything was provisioned with Terraform.

It was an enriching experience that combined hands-on learning and real-world application of multicloud technologies!
