## Introduction

Choosing the right framework can accelerate your cloud journey and ensure your workloads are secure, efficient, and aligned with business goals. When working with Microsoft Azure, two key frameworks help guide your cloud journey: the **Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** and the **Well-Architected Framework (WAF)**. Each serves a distinct purpose and supports different stages of your cloud strategy.

## Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)

**What is it?**  
CAF is Microsoftâ€™s end-to-end guide for planning and executing your move to the cloud. It covers every phase, from defining business strategy to managing and governing your Azure environment.

**Purpose:**

- Align cloud adoption with business goals
- Guide strategy, planning, migration, modernization, governance, and operations
- Reduce risk and accelerate cloud success

**When to use:**

- At the start of your cloud journey
- When planning migrations, setting up governance, or managing costs and security
- During digital transformation or IT restructuring

**Practical example:**
Use CAF when planning a large-scale migration or establishing a landing zone pre-configured Azure environment with governance, security, and compliance best practices built in. This ensures your workloads start in a well-architected, controlled environment from day one.

## Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)

**What is it?**  
WAF is a set of best practices and principles for designing, building, and running high-quality workloads on Azure. It helps you evaluate and improve your architecture.

**Purpose:**

- Ensure workloads are reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-optimized
- Provide actionable guidance for new and existing solutions

**When to use:**

- When designing or reviewing solution architectures
- For technical assessments, audits, or optimization

**Practical example:**
Use WAF when reviewing the security, cost, or performance of a new web service or optimizing an existing application. Azure Advisor can help by providing automated assessments and recommendations directly aligned with the Well-Architected Framework pillars, supporting continuous improvement in reliability, security, cost, and performance.

## Key Differences


| Aspect        | Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)       | Well-Architected Framework (WAF)      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Focus        | Cloud journey, governance, management | Workload quality and architecture      |
| Scope        | Strategy, migration, governance, ops  | Design, build, operate workloads       |
| When to use  | Start and evolve your cloud adoption  | Design, review, and optimize workloads |
| Example uses | Migration planning, landing zones     | Security, cost, and performance reviews|

---

## Summary

The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) helps you build a strong foundation for your Azure journey, ensuring your environment is secure, governed, and ready for growth. The Well-Architected Framework (WAF) empowers you to design, review, and optimize workloads for reliability, security, performance, and cost-effectiveness. By combining both frameworks, you accelerate cloud adoption and continuously improve your solutions, maximizing value and minimizing risk in Azure.
