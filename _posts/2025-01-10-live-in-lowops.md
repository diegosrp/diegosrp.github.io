On January 10th, 2025, I had the pleasure of making my first appearance on Rafael Ferreira’s LowOps channel for a laid-back chat. 💬

I must admit, I’m more of a low-profile person and usually stay behind the scenes, but with the new year and its challenges ahead, I decided to accept the invitation to share a bit about my professional journey, as well as the challenges and lessons learned during my move to New Zealand.<br><br>
I talked about the experiences that shaped me in the tech field and in the market. 🌏✨
