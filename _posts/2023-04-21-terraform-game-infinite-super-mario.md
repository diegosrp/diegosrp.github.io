Are you a fan of the iconic game Mario? If you've played it before, you'll know it's an absolute classic! And if you've seen the recent movie "Super Mario Bros," you'll know what I mean.

To relive those good old days and have some fun, I created an automation using Terraform + Azure, utilizing the concept of a "module" to deploy the **Infinite Super Mario game**.
