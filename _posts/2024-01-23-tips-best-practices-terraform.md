##### For those taking their first steps into Terraform and feeling a bit lost, I recommend this free book. It focuses on describing the best practices for using Terraform, providing not only fundamental guidance but also valuable tips. The book is available in over 15 languages, translated by native speakers in the community. Moreover, it is relevant not only for beginners but also for experienced professionals, offering useful insights.
